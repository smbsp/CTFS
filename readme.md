## Introduction

Ethereum CTFs are interactive security challenges designed to educate players on smart contract vulnerabilities. Each challenge typically involves identifying and exploiting security flaws in Ethereum smart contracts. This repository contains my solutions to these challenges, with the goal of helping others learn and improve their smart contract security skills.

## List of CTFs

### Ethernaut

[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) is a Web3/Solidity-based wargame played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be hacked.

- **Level 1: Fallback**
- **Level 2: Fallout**
- **Level 3: Coin Flip**
- **Level 4: Telephone**
- **Level 5: Token**
- **Level 6: Delegation**
- **Level 7: Force**
- **Level 8: Vault**
- **Level 9: King**
- **Level 10: Reentrancy**
- **...**

### Capture the Ether

[Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/) is another game of Ethereum smart contract security challenges. The game consists of a series of challenges in different categories, each focusing on specific types of vulnerabilities.

- **Warmup: Hello Ethernaut**
- **Lotteries: Predict the future**
- **Lotteries: Predict the block hash**
- **Math: Token sale**
- **Math: Token whale**
- **...**

### Damn Vulnerable DeFi

[Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) is a set of challenges focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi) vulnerabilities.

- **Challenge 1: Unstoppable**
- **Challenge 2: Naive receiver**
- **Challenge 3: Truster**
- **Challenge 4: Side entrance**
- **Challenge 5: The rewarder**
- **...**

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/smbsp/ctfs.git
    cd ctfs
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the desired CTF challenge.

3. Read through the solution and understand the exploitation technique used.

4. Try to replicate the solution on your local setup.
